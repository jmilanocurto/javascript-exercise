    <p>
      The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is a CAD data exchange data schema
      intended for description of architectural, building and construction
      industry data.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a platform-neutral, open data schema specification that is not
      controlled by a single vendor or group of vendors. It is an object-based
      data schema with a data model developed by buildingSMART (formerly the
      International Alliance for Interoperability, IAI) to facilitate
      interoperability in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC)
      industry, and is a commonly used collaboration format in Building
      Information Modeling (BIM) based projects. The IFC model specification is
      open and available. It is registered by ISO and is an official
      International Standard ISO 16739.<br />
    </p>
    <h3 class="sub-header">What does IFC mean?</h3>
    <p>
      In general, IFC, or “Industry Foundation Classes”, is a standardized,
      digital description of the built environment, including buildings and
      civil infrastructure.It is an open, international standard (ISO
      16739-1:2018), meant to be vendor-neutral, or agnostic, and usable across
      a wide range of hardware devices, software platforms, and interfaces for
      many different use cases. The IFC schema specification is the primary
      technical deliverable of buildingSMART International to fulfill its goal
      to promote openBIM®.
    </p>
    <p>
      More specifically, the IFC schema is a standardized data model that
      codifies, in a logical way, the following items:<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the identity and semantics</li>
      <li>the characteristics or attributes</li>
      <li>relationships of objects</li>
      <li>abstract concepts</li>
      <li>processes</li>
      <li>people</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The schema specification can describe how a facility or installation is
      used, how it is constructed, and how it is operated. IFC can define
      physical components of buildings, manufactured products,
      mechanical/electrical systems, as well as more abstract structural
      analysis models, energy analysis models, cost breakdowns, work schedules,
      and much, much more.
    </p>
    <h3 class="sub-header">Who uses IFC?</h3>
    <p>
      Hundreds of software applications for use by many different stakeholders
      in the process can send and receive IFC data. Since 1997, IFC has been
      tried and tested through many iterations, gaining worldwide trust as a
      means to deliver projects from all over the world.
